    SPARQLLM is a Retrieval-Augmented SPARQL Query engine. In this approach, external sources can be discovered during SPARQL query execution, allowing for the dynamic creation of a Knowledge Graph.
SPARQLLM is built on top of RDFLIB and is available at [https://github.com/momo54/SPARQLLM](https://github.com/momo54/SPARQLLM)

    - We have the Knowledge Graph of our curricula in Computer Science in Nantes. It describes the lectures with their description, their level, their objective etc. But we don't know how the lectures of the master covers expected knowledge of a master in computer science.

    - The problem is to align the lectures of our curricula with 0 or many knowledge units of the ACM CS Curricula.

    - The Knowledge Graph of our Master in Computer Science in Nantes is just a Turtle File.

    - We wrote a Retreival-Augmented SPARQLLLM query that perform alignments as a CONSTRUCT query that augment the origin Knowledge Graph

    - We wrote a UI allowing to see the profiles of the different track of Master in Nantes.
