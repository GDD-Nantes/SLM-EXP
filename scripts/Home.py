    - SPARQLLM is a Retrieval-Augmented SPARQL Query engine. 
      - Many times, information is not available in the Knowledge Graph but in external sources.
      - SPARQLLM can search and extract knowledge from external sources  during query processing
    - The key idea is to have User-Defined Functions (UDFs) to dynamically generate named graphs by retrieving relevant information from external sources.
